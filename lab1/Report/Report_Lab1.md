## Objectives:

* Study and understand the SOLID Principles.
* Choose a domain, define its main classes/models/entities and choose the appropriate instantiation mechanisms.
* Create a sample project that respects SOLID Principles.

## Main tasks:
* Choose an OO programming language and a suitable IDE or Editor (No frameworks/libs/engines allowed).

* Select a domain area for the sample project.

* Define the main involved classes and think about what instantiation mechanisms are needed.

* Respect SOLID Principles in your project.



## Theory:
&ensp;  The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that help developers create more maintainable and understandable software by promoting clean and flexible object-oriented design. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and have become fundamental concepts in software development. The SOLID acronym stands for:
* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single responsibility. In other words, a class should have one and only one job or responsibility. This helps in keeping classes focused and easier to understand, maintain, and modify.
* Open-Closed Principle (OCP): The Open-Closed Principle emphasizes that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you can add new functionality to a module without altering its existing code. It encourages the use of inheritance, interfaces, and abstract classes to extend behavior.
* Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a derived class should be able to replace objects of the base class without affecting the correctness of the program. In simpler terms, if a class is a subclass of another class, it should be usable as a drop-in replacement for its base class without causing unexpected behavior.
* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): This principle suggests that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. It encourages the creation of specific, smaller interfaces tailored to the needs of the clients rather than creating large, monolithic interfaces. This helps in preventing client classes from being coupled to methods they don't need.
* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): The Dependency Inversion Principle promotes decoupling between high-level modules (classes) and low-level modules (classes). It suggests that both should depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes), not on concrete implementations. This inversion of dependencies allows for flexibility and easier maintenance by enabling the substitution of implementations without affecting the high-level code.
